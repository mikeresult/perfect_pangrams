NodeJS Typescript search algorithm for finding perfect pangrams: sets of words with all 26 letters exactly once

# Note about "words.txt"

The source word list could not be included in this repository because I believe it may be a copyrighted document. The file I used had 172,821 words with no acronyms or abbreviations. I've tried this program with a longer list that included acronyms and it just crashed after a little while for reasons that I can't be bothered to care about.
